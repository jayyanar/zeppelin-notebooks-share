# zeppelin-notebooks

These notebooks have been developed specifically for use with a Spark Workshop being taught by Paul Hargis.

These notebooks should work with Zeppelin 0.6.0+ 

They have the updated datetime format that is required for proper parsing by the GSON library.

In order to import them into your own running instance of Zeppelin, start by clicking the "Import Note" button on the home page. Give your copy of the note a name, and then click in the URL box and paste the source URL there. The source URL can be obtained by clicking on the notebook here on this github site, and then clicking the "raw" button and copying the URL from the browser address bar.
